# JFlex vs. Unicode

Code to experiment the support of multiple Unicode escape sequences for codes outside of the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).
Originally this was to verify the changes in https://github.com/oracle/opengrok/pull/4735

Most of the code was taken from https://github.com/jflex-de/jflex/tree/master/jflex/examples/simple
